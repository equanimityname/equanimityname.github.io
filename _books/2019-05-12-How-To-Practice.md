author_bio: 	"Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso (born Lhamo Dondrub), the 14th Dalai Lama, is a practicing member of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism and is influential as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the world's most famous Buddhist monk, and the leader of the exiled Tibetan government in India. Tenzin Gyatso was the fifth of sixteen children born to a farming family. He was proclaimed the tulku (an Enlightened lama who has consciously decided to take rebirth) of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, he was enthroned as Tibet's ruler. Thus he became Tibet's most important political ruler just one month after the People's Republic of China's invasion of Tibet on 7 October 1950. In 1954, he went to Beijing to attempt peace talks with Mao Zedong and other leaders of the PRC. These talks ultimately failed. After a failed uprising and the collapse of the Tibetan resistance movement in 1959, the Dalai Lama left for India, where he was active in establishing the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan Government in Exile) and in seeking to preserve Tibetan culture and education among the thousands of refugees who accompanied him. A charismatic figure and noted public speaker, this Dalai Lama is the first to travel to the West. There, he has helped to spread Buddhism and to promote the concepts of universal responsibility, secular ethics, and religious harmony."

first_blockquote: 	"True change is within; leave the outside as it is."
second_blockquote: 	"My earnest request is that you practice love and kindness whether you believe in a religion or not."
third_blockquote: 	"In the frenzy of modern life we lose sight of the real value of humanity. People become the sum total of what they produce. Human beings act like machines whose function is to make money. This is absolutely wrong. The purpose of making money is the happiness of humankind, not the other way round. Humans are not for money, money is for humans. We need enough to live, so money is necessary, but we also need to realize that if there is too much attachment to wealth, it does not help at all. As the saints of India and Tibet tell us, the wealthier one becomes, the more suffering one endures."

review_overview: 	["<a href='https://amzn.to/2vUOjB0'>How to Practice: The Way to a Meaningful life</a> opens with a comparison between what most consider the two paths for finding happiness: through focusing on external gain like professional and financial success, and through mental development. Those familiar with Buddhism will know in advance that the 14th Dalai Lama will always advocate for the later while quickly dismissing the former. The first chapters take a look at the path followed by Buddha towards enlightenment and gives us a road-map for the rest of the book that outlines the importance of practicing morality above all.","The next sections follow a general idea: mind of a moral person, not burdened by guilt or regret can then be trained to achieve high levels of stable concentration which in turn is necessary to gain wisdom through meditation."]
skill_level_overview: 	["We have chosen to categorize this book as beneficial both for beginners and advanced practitioners. The first chapters will prove useful to people interested in gaining knowledge from within who still don't have a clear idea on how it can be done. The later chapters do touch on more difficult subjects such as Tantras and actionable instructions towards reaching enlightenment (yes, we know this is not something that should be reached, or accomplished, words sometimes fail to express what the Buddha tried to convey)."]
approach_overview: 	["When it comes to the approach, the title can be a little misleading because this is not a purely pragmatic book. How to Practice finds a good balance between the practical and the theoretical by giving specific instructions to follow and offering guidance along the way through common obstacles, while taking the time to talk about where the path being taught comes from and what are the philosophical foundations behind it."]
outlook_overview: 	["Even though the author is recognized around the world for having a somewhat counterintuitive interest in science since a young age, it should come to nobody's surprise that <b>How to Practice</b> falls in the spiritual category. One of the later chapters into the book is named <i>Tantra</i> and discusses how to follow the spiritual path by using imagination and Tantra","Secular readers will still find value within these pages particularly if they're trying to get a better understanding of what Buddhism is all about."]
affiliation_overview: 	["As an accomplished writer, his Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has a way with words unlike other Buddhist teachers out there. It could be argued that he is one of the most culturally aware religious personalities out there. Due to his openness and dedication to travel the world to form bridges between different cultures and religions, you can always expect him to include messages to non Buddhist people in his writings; this book isn't the exception.","While the above holds true, this book is made up of a majority of Buddhist teachings and includes sections on topics that are exclusive to the religion such as <i>The Four Noble Truths</i> and <i>Enlightenment</i>, making it fall in the sectarian category for this review."]
techniques: 	[metta, compassion, mindfulness, samatha, vipassana, concentration, wisdom]
conclusion: 	["If you find yourself looking for a more broad approach that encompasses different practices, I encourage you to take a look at our review of <a href='/Books/the-mind-illuminated'>The Mind Illuminated</a> instead, and if you'd like a more in depth look about the different subjects the Buddha taught, there's no better place to start than <a href='/Books/the-heart-of-the-buddhas-teaching'>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</a>."]
