author_bio: 	"Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso (born Lhamo DÃ¶ndrub), the 14th Dalai Lama, is a practicing member of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism and is influential as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the world's most famous Buddhist monk, and the leader of the exiled Tibetan government in India.

Tenzin Gyatso was the fifth of sixteen children born to a farming family. He was proclaimed the tulku (an Enlightened lama who has consciously decided to take rebirth) of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two.

Tenzin Gyatso is a charismatic figure and noted public speaker. This Dalai Lama is the first to travel to the West. There, he has helped to spread Buddhism and to promote the concepts of universal responsibility, secular ethics, and religious harmony."

first_blockquote: 	"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."
second_blockquote: 	Whether our action is wholesome or unwholesome depends on whether that action or deed arises from a disciplined or undisciplined state of mind. It is felt that a disciplined mind leads to happiness and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering, and in fact it is said that bringing about discipline within one's mind is the essence of the Buddha's teaching.
third_blockquote: 	"If you approach others with the thought of compassion, that will automatically reduce fear and allow an openness with other people. It creates a positive, friendly atmosphere. With that attitude, you can approach a relationship in which you, yourself, initially create the possibility of receiving affection or a positive response from the other person. And with that attitude, even if the other person is unfriendly or doesn't respond to you in a positive way, then at least you've approached the person with a feeling of openness that gives you a certain flexibility and the freedom to change your approach as needed."

review_overview: 	["Co-written with Howard C. Cutler, a professional psychiatrist, <a href='https://amzn.to/2Q3GVg2'>The Art of Happiness</a> separates itself from other books written by the fourteenth Dalai Lama in that it is meant to work as a guide, for people who are not yet acquainted with Buddhism, to live a happier, more compassionate life.", "Born out of conversations Cutler had with Tenzin Gyatso on many occasions, the book is aimed at answering questions related to happiness, it's main subject as the title implies, such as <i>is happiness a right?</i> or <i>what is the source of happiness?</i>."]
skill_level_overview: 	["Some members of our meditation center read The Art of Happiness before they got interested in Buddhism or meditation, and all of them remember fondly how it helped demystify the persona built around the Dalai Lama, a concept some find too foreign; one specific friend of mine recalls frequently referring to him as <i>the pope of Buddhism</i> many years ago. For them, this book is a recommended reading for anyone who's wondering who this <i>Buddha</i> person everyone's talking about was.","Categorized as a book for beginners, advanced practitioners will for sure enjoy reading it and will find the topics discussed familiar."]
approach_overview: 	["When it comes to the approach, most practical teachings are found towards the end of the book and are not necessarily related to mediation but more oriented towards overcoming general obstacles in life such as low self-esteem or dealing with feelings of anger."]
outlook_overview: 	["In The Art of Happiness we can find the best of both worlds precisely because of the opposite areas of expertise of each of its writers. You can be sure the Dalai Lama will provide all the spiritual insight you're looking for; there's even a whole section of the book focused on how to live a spiritual life. Offering a perfect balance, Cutler's  psychiatric knowledge serves to explain in terms that secular oriented people will appreciate, what his holiness is trying to convey.","A Tibetan and an American, a Monk and a Psychiatrist, after all, suffering is common to every human being that ever existed and thousands of people from both of these walks of life have devoted hundreds of years to accumulating knowledge about it."]
affiliation_overview: 	["As I said in the opening paragraph, this book stands out precisely because it was written by the highest ranking monk of one of the biggest sects of Buddhism and yet it's not meant for Buddhists at all. Most Catholics would agree in saying that Jesus' most important teaching was to love others more than you love yourself; we're pretty sure that Jesus would approve this book's message of compassion and kindness, and we're certain fellow non-believers will as well."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness, vippasana, compassion, loving-kindness, metta]
conclusion: 	["If you're trying to find a book that presents a more broad approach encompassing different practices, I encourage you to take a look at our review of <a href='/Books/the-mind-illuminated'>The Mind Illuminated</a>. If, on the other hand you'd like to learn more about the different subjects the Buddha taught, there's no better place to start than <a href='/Books/the-heart-of-the-buddhas-teaching'>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</a>."]
