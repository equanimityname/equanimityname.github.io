author: 	"Eckhart Tolle"
author_bio: 	"Eckhart Tolle, born Ulrich Leonard Tolle, February 16, 1948, is a German-born writer, public speaker, and spiritual teacher. The New York Times has called him 'the most popular spiritual author in the nation'. He is the author of the bestsellers 'The Power of Now' and 'A New Earth'. Tolle had an unhappy childhood in Germany and Spain. His depression reached its peak during early adulthood in England, until he underwent what he calls an 'inner transformation'. He then spent many years as a vagrant, 'in a a state of deep bliss', he says, before becoming a spiritual teacher. He eventually moved to North America where he began writing his first book. He currently lives in Vancouver, Canada with his wife, Kim Eng."

first_blockquote: 	"Realize deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary focus of your life."
second_blockquote: 	"Time isn’t precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time—past and future—the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is."
third_blockquote: 	"All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and
not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms
of non forgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence."

review_overview: 	["<a href='https://amzn.to/2YnqZIm'>The Power of Now</a> is an international best seller which left a mark in our culture by contributing to the widespread of Mindfulness practices across the west. As such, its value cannot be understated and should be mandatory reading for anyone who by their own means arrives at the conclusion that thinking 24/7 is not contributing positively to their state of mind.","The book is written in a Q&A format so author is answering questions the reader might have herself and so it gives a feeling of familiarity and a conversational tone; two ingredients that can cause you to get hooked and read it in just a couple of sessions."]
skill_level_overview: 	["This book is meant to be read for people starting out on the path towards living a more mindful life. The message is repeated and presented in multiple ways across the chapters so the reader will retain the knowledge contained within its pages. A lesson found in the first chapters will come back in the final ones with a new twist thus helping solidify the idea.","Advanced practitioners might not get much out of it in the way of fresh ideas, but reading Eckhart's examples can have the effect of strengthening your conviction and offering points of view that hadn't been considered before."]
approach_overview: 	["Because Mindfulness practice doesn't necessarily rely on complicated instructions, The Power of Now can be categorized both as a practical and a theoretical book. The first chapters are heavy in theory and will prepare you for the rest of the road by laying out some important definitions like consciousness, and breaking paradigms like <i>you are not your mind</i>, which is the title of the first section that follows the introduction.","Later on, the author provides you with applicable strategies that will help you slow down the chatter created by your thoughts while bringing down the curtain on the tricks the mind itself plays on you in order to prevent that from happening."]
outlook_overview: 	["The title tries hard to present this book as a spiritual one. It definitely was written using plenty of words that usually take a spiritual connotation and might make secular inclined people uncomfortable. However, we feel this book deserves recognition for also taking an in depth review on issues and situations any regular person will be able to identify with. From relationships to jobs, there's something to be found for everyone and you shouldn't dismiss this book as spiritual mumbo jumbo if that's not your cup of tea.","Because nowadays the key takeaway of being more present in the moment can be found in psychology and science books all around, it would be unfair to shy away from reading it out of aversion to words some might consider loaded such as <i>God</i> or <i>manifestation</i>."]
affiliation_overview: 	["There's been some debate on whether this book uses some kind of camouflage to send a Christian message, but that's just not true in our opinion. We have categorized this book as open because it doesn't adhere to any one particular creed other than being fully in the present moment.","It might be worth mentioning that there's some criticism out there as Christians don't like the loose way in which the word <i>God</i> is use on occasion. The author himself has explained that the word escapes definition and is used to convey <i>'the thing itself'</i>. Some Buddhists also like to mention that the book is a watered down version of one of their main teachings, as if it mattered who came up with the idea of Mindfulness, but that's something no person striving to towards enlightenment should do."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness, awareness]
conclusion: 	["Both the Buddha and The Power of Now promote mindfulness as a way to find peace and happiness, the difference lying in the fact that the later considers it the only determining factor while Buddhist teachings present it as only one of the eight factors leading to awakening or the <i>eightfold noble path</i>. If you'd like to learn more about the other seven and don't know where to start, I recommend you to take a look at our review of <a href='/Books/the-heart-of-the-buddhas-teaching'>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</a>.", "Alternatively, if you're not interested in Buddhism but are looking for instructions on a wider variety of meditation practices, consider giving <a href='/Books/the-mind-illuminated'>The Mind Illuminated</a> a try."]
