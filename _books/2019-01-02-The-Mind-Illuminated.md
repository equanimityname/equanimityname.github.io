first_blockquote: 	"All the mental skills needed in meditation are innate abilities we can selectively choose to cultivate."
second_blockquote: 	“Of course, it’s much harder to stay mindful when it matters most, in difficult situations. That’s why we need to intentionally practice mindfulness in everyday life, especially when it’s easy, like when you’re driving a car or eating a meal. Then, you’ll build up the skill and the “mental muscle” to stay mindful in the face of greater challenges.” 
third_blockquote: 	“Our past shapes our current perceptions and behaviors, and unresolved issues can stand in the way of peace of mind, joy, and happiness in the present.”

review_overview: 	["If you're looking to find the closest there is to a step by the step meditation guide,  you will be happy to learn that Upasaka Culadasa (John Yates) was able to transform years of experience meditating into exactly that. This book is divided into ten different <i>stages</i> meant to represent different milestones in the path to becoming an adept.","Full of helpful illustrations and exercises, this book could be said to play the part of a master tending to a disciple. The clear description of the progression facilitates collaboration between meditators and practitioners, so some thriving communities can be found online."]
skill_level_overview: 	["The Mind Illuminated serves as a fully comprehensive meditation guide and the level of detail put into it surprised even the most well-versed meditation teachers out there. Whether you're just starting out on the path or you whether you already have many hours of sits under your belt, this book is sure to have something  for everyone.","The book starts with a chapter covering something most people struggle with: how to establish a daily practice. As with every other talent, an maybe even more so with meditation, progress will happen earlier if you're committed to sitting every day. The author encourages starting small, meditating a couple of minutes a day is all you need at this point because you're only trying to form a habit","On the other side of the spectrum, the final chapters deal with attaining deep levels of absorption and ultimately, awakening. In order to do so, a mix of both <i>Samatha</i> and <i>Vipassana</i> practices are discussed."]
approach_overview: 	["When it comes to approach, the book manages to structure the teachings orderly by using the ten stages and setting precisely detailed milestones, such as: <i>Gross distractions no longer push the breath into the background, and breath sensation don't fade or become distorted due to strong dullness</i>. Terms such as <b>gross distractions</b> and <b> strong dullness</b> are also defined accurately an at length so you as a reader succeed to know when to follow one instruction or other.","As advertised in the title, this book will work as a practical guide and covers techniques as varying as Metta meditation to Walking meditation, but the main approach relies on developing strong attention and awareness and cultivating a calm stable mind."]
outlook_overview: 	["As you would expect from the pencil of a Ph. D. who became an Upasaka, or dedicated lay-practitioner, the book balances neuroscience, philosophy, and Buddhist teachings without pushing a specific agenda too much. This is not to say that the religion or sect of the author is kept a secret, as we'll discuss in the next point..."]
affiliation_overview: 	["It could be argued that Culadasa is a teacher and the head of a Buddhist Shanga himself and so this book should fall in the sectarian category, however the instructions themselves are provided in plain English whenever possible.","While the above holds true, Buddhist terminology is presented frequently to establish a clear link to the past and thousand year old terms take on a new life for 21st century readers. Followers of any current and non-followers alike will still appreciate the openness of the teachings and the down to earth way in which they're expounded."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness, vippasana, samatha, walking meditation, awareness, anapanasati]
conclusion: 	["The Mind Illuminated joins the rank of great classics bringing to the fore a path that feels surprisingly accessible. If you want to connect on a more spiritual level, We'd recommend you to take a look at <a href='/Books/TheHeartOfTheBuddhasTeaching'>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</a> instead."]
