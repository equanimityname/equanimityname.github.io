first_blockquote: 	"Busy your mind with the concepts of harmony, health, peace, and good will, and wonders will happen in your life."
second_blockquote: 	"Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress."
third_blockquote: 	"What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, 'respond' rather than simply 'react'. In the Buddhist view, you canâ€™t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it."

review_overview: 	["<a href='https://amzn.to/2Ys2HNi'>10% Happier</a> is the brainchild of a TV personality who one day realized he needed to make a change in his life if he wanted to keep doing what he loved. After spending time in the middle east covering various war zones, the author returned to his job in the United States and, due to his newly developed PTSD, he turned to cocaine and other drugs for relief.","The turning point for him came during a live TV show broadcast; he was reporting the news as he usually did and suffered a panic attack that came out of nowhere. Because of this event, his wife recommended him to read <a href='/Books/the-power-of-now'>The Power of Now</a> and, as an skeptic man, he thought little of. That didn't stop him however from having his first spiritual realization, and learning that we all have a <i>voice</i> inside us, and that it doesn't always try to help, caused him to start the research that would eventually become this international bestseller."]
skill_level_overview: 	["Because these pages are meant to describe the personal journey undergone by its author, 10% Happier is one of the most accesible books out there for people who want to get a taste of what mindfulness and meditation are all about. ","Advanced practitioners who don't expect to gain much in terms of novel insights will be thrilled to read it like a novel and could get pleasure out of following Dan Harris' 'character arc' until its conclusion."]
approach_overview: 	["10% Happier doesn't offer much beyond the basics in terms of practical instructions. The author has expressed in multiple occasions, through interviews and other TV appearances, that his purpose is to quietly push people towards meditation. In this sense, the book spends more time introducing the basis and the benefits of establishing a regular practice. The fact that our brains can be trained with repetitions just as you would a muscle, is repeated multiple times and is used to convey the worldy way in which he wants his message to be interpreted.","The beginning sections of the book also double as journalistic articles where Dan guides us through the story of how he became interested in meditation and Buddhist teachings, with the same talent he had shown hundreds of times before when telling stories about other people."]
outlook_overview: 	["Dan Harris is not affiliated to any one religion and often refers to what he is doing as contributing to public health; it doesn't get more secular than that.","Buddhist teachings are used for reference when needed in much the same way you would mention the ancient Greeks when talking about the Olympic Games. The main enemy, according to Dan, is a concept with no direct relation to religions or spiritual practices: your ego. Add to that the fact that he chooses to use terms accepted by psychologists like <i>habitual response</i>, and you'll understand why we categorized this book as secular."]
affiliation_overview: 	["Whether you're a Christian, a Buddhist, or an atheist you will not find issue with the thoughts expressed in this book. Dan takes inspiration mostly from Buddhism and his personal life, but up to this day he still holds that he's not sure if he believes in <i>enlightenment</i>. His instructions are more akin to mental health tips and his objective leading a good, well-balanced life."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness]
conclusion: 	["If you'd like to follow behind the steps of the author, there's no better way to do so than reading the book his wife recommended; take a look at our review for <a href='/Books/the-power-of-now'>The Power of Now</a> by <a href='/Authors/eckhart-tolle'>Eckhart Tolle</a>. If you already read 10% Happier and liked it, you might like <a href='/Books/mindfulness-in-plain-english'>Mindfulness in Plain English</a> too."]
