author_bio: 	"Bhante Henepola Gunaratana is the founding abbot of the Bhavana Society. Born in rural Sri Lanka, he has been a monk since age 12 and took full ordination at age 20 in 1947. He came to the United States in 1968. Bhante G (as he is fondly called by his students) regularly leads retreats on vipassana, mindfulness, metta (Loving-friendliness), concentration, and other topics both at the Bhavana Society and elsewhere.

Bhante Gunaratana is an internationally recognized author and meditation teacher. Prior to coming to the United States, he spent five years doing in missionary work with the Harijanas (Untouchables) of India and ten years in Malaysia. He has taught in a number of settings, including American University of Washington DC where he served as Buddhist chaplain and the Buddhist Vihara of Washington DC, where he served as president."

first_blockquote: 	"The irony of it is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing itâ€”another Catch-22."
second_blockquote: 	"Deeply buried in the mind, there lies a mechanism that accepts what the mind experiences as beautiful and pleasant and rejects those experiences that are perceived as ugly and painful. This mechanism gives rise to those states of mind that we are training ourselves to avoid-- things like greed, lust, hatred, aversion, and jealousy."
third_blockquote: 	"Learning to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is essential in vipassana meditation."

review_overview: 	["The best known work of Bhante G, as we will call him in this review, contains knowledge and practical instructions that will resonate with beginners and advanced practitioners alike. The book takes its time preparing a solid foundation for people who are not well versed in Mindfulness, its main subject, and ingrains a desire to be more present in you, the reader. Awareness in the present moment and the related subjects are well known today, but they were not 20 years ago and the author took it upon himself to help introduce the concepts; there's some added value in reading works considered pioneering.","Everyday situations are used as the base to lay out Buddhist teachings and a great deal of effort was put into transmitting the message that our lives can be better if we apply the right effort in the right practices. Read more about how this book is categorized next."]
skill_level_overview: 	["Mindfulness in Plain English first chapters should be mandatory reading for anyone interested in Mindfulness. Before giving indications on how to practice, the book takes its time to explain why you should do it in the first place. For beginners, this is excellent motivation because without having clear reasons for meditating, it will be difficult to establish a consistent practice","On the other hand, the instructions themselves are not meant for the faint hearted; they clearly indicate that you should start by sitting for periods of half an hour or longer, which might sound daunting to some. If you're looking for an easy step by step guide to meditation, this is not it."]
approach_overview: 	["With a little bit of both worlds, Mindfulness in Plain English works well both as a practical and as a theoretical guide. Apart from the theory we mentioned in the Skill Level section, there are entire chapters dedicated to discussing more of the foundation and debunking common myths about meditation.","Instructions themselves are straightforward and describe a whole picture of the practice, from what happens with your body while you meditate to what's going on inside your mind. Obstacles you might find along the way are discussed in detail and thus it is fairly easy to pick up this book weeks or months after putting it down in order to see how Bhante G recommends you overcome it."]
outlook_overview: 	["Although it might mainly be appealing to Buddhists, when writing this book the author made sure not to forget about secular practitioners. The last couple of chapters are dedicated to help common people meditate throughout the day regardless of how busy life can be in modern times.","Buddhist teachings are mentioned often and yes, the author is a monk, but mindfulness is treated here as a human condition so anyone regardless of beliefs will be able to relate to the theory and follow the instructions."]
affiliation_overview: 	["As you should expect from Bhante G, the contents of Mindfulness in Plain English are Buddhist in nature. Its main practice, Vipassana, is normally associated with Buddhism and throughout the first couple of reads you will feel how living the life of a monk has changed the life of its author forever. It's also worth mentioning at this point that <a href='/{{ baseurl }}/Authors/JonKabatZinn'>Jon Kabat-Zinn</a> called this book a 'Masterpiece' and he is a professor of Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness, vipassana, samatha, metta]
conclusion: 	["If you find yourself looking for a more broad approach that encompasses different practices, I encourage you to take a look at our review of <a href='/{{ baseurl }}/Books/TheMindIlluminated'>The Mind Illuminated</a> instead, and if you'd like to learn more about Buddha and his teachings, there's no better place to start than <a href='/{{ baseurl }}/TheHeartOfTheBuddhasTeaching'>The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching</a>"]
