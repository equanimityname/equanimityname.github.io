author_bio: 	"Thich Nhat Hanh is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, teacher, author, poet and peace activist who now lives in southwest France where he was in exile for many years. Born Nguyen Xuan Bao, Thich Nhat Hanh joined a Zen (Vietnamese: Thien) monastery at the age of 16, and studied Buddhism as a novitiate. Upon his ordination as a monk in 1949, he assumed the Dharma name Thich Nhat Hanh. Thich is an honorary family name used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of the Shakya (Shakyamuni Buddha) clan. He is often considered the most influential living figure in the lineage of Lam Te (Vietnamese Rinzai) Thien, and perhaps also in Zen Buddhism as a whole."

review_overview: 	["The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching is a timeless piece written for westerners in an attempt to describe the most important teachings of the Buddha. As a poet, the author manages to teach us everything we need to know about the Dhamma and make us feel heart-warm at the same time through the use of beautiful analogies.","After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha decided to transfer what he had learned to a group of fellow ascetics who had practiced with him in the past. This decision meant he would have to structure the teachings in an orderly way so others could follow logically from one to the next. Thich Nhat Hanh stayed true to the original teacher and organized chapters in this book to build up upon the previous ones in much the same sequence followed over two thousand years ago."]
skill_level_overview: 	["Beginners are welcome here. As a great introduction to Buddhism, this work takes the time to explain why the teachings make sense and guides you through the process until you can arrive at your own conclusions. If you've been interested in Buddhism for some years now, there might be little for you in terms of novelty.","In that case, I would argue that even if you have already developed mindfulness and know your way around describing what <i>the three doors of liberation</i> are, there's a lot of value between these pages. Every so often one finds a book where the voice of the writer matters more than its contents or its narrative, and this book is a great example; reading it is a meditation in itself and, when you put it down, you always feel calmer than when you started."]
approach_overview: 	["There are practices described in this book that are meant to be followed, most of them related to mindfulness and awareness of the present moment, and with each new one that is presented, Thich Nhat Hanh helps us understand why it works and why we should care to develop those abilities in the first place.","The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching, however, falls in the Theoretical category because it's main preoccupation is to pass what the Buddha taught, not meditation, to the minds of people who are taking their first steps into the Dhamma."]
outlook_overview: 	["Secular oriented practitioners can benefit from reading this book from a philosophical standpoint even if it's intended for audiences with Buddhist tendencies. When it comes to Buddhism, it's easy to find parallels with psychology, biology, and other sciences, so although it falls in the spiritual category, don't be afraid to pick it up and decide for yourself."]
affiliation_overview: 	["As it name hints, this is a strictly Buddhist book even in it's structure. The earlier contents deal with Buddhist concepts such as <i>the noble eightfold path</i> for each of which an entire chapter is dedicated. Towards the end, in the third part of the book inappropriately named <i>Other Basic Buddhist Teachings</i>, more advanced topics are discussed such as <i>the five powers</i> or <i>the six paramitas</i>; most consider these to be advanced topics within Buddhism but are presented here in an accessible way so beginners start to get acquainted with what the Buddha taught.","Specifically, Thich Nhat Hanh identifies with the Zen school of Buddhism and knowledgeable readers will be able to notice some particular Zen details between the lines, but maybe because it is meant to serve as an introduction to Buddhism, this is not a Zen Buddhism book per se."]
techniques: 	[mindfulness, nothingness, walking meditation, awareness, concentration, zen]
conclusion: 	["Whether you're starting out on the path or consider yourself an adept, The Heart of the Buddha's teaching is a must-have for your book shelve. Beginners will discover little by little what makes Buddhist teachings so appealing to millions, and advanced practitioners will smile and breath slowly when navigating the poetry it contains.","Already a best seller, you will find that this two decade old book remains as relevant today as it was when first published. If, however, you're looking for a practical guide, we'd recommend you to take a look at <a href='/Books/TheMindIlluminated'>The Mind Illuminated</a> instead."]
